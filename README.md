# A basic Platformer game

- The project is kind of incomplete.
- It uses C with raylib.
- I got free assets in the `assets` directory from [here](https://craftpix.net/freebies/filter/sprites/).

## Building process
- Assuming C and raylib both are setup in your machine, run `./build.sh` in the terminal. On windows, I recommend getting the git bash terminal (or the sh.exe executable) that comes with [git](https://git-scm.com/) to run the scripts.
